### Introduction

This is my repo for Peking University OS Labs course. Peking University OS Lab (Honor Track) course. This course adapted contents from 2014 MIT 6.828, so this should also be helpful for other students studing any MIT 6.828 like courses.

I post it here to as a reference for future attendents of this course. During my own experence of completing those labs, I found other's repo extremely helpful. I hope that my homework can also be helpful to others, especially in the following aspects:

* A insight of what completed code should looks like.
* A correct version to be compare to when debugging an extremely concealed bug.
* A reference of programming style. (I tried to program a clean and decent code throughtout every lab. Hope you can do it better.)

In the meanwhile, I disapprove the following way of using this repo:

* Source for plagiarize homework

Hope you have a good experence in completing those labs. Don't forget to star me if you find this helpful.

### Status

All the labs (including lab 6) are finished. According to course requirement, I have also finished at least one challenge for each lab.

### Usage

If you would like to find code for a specific lab, please look at the corresponding branch.

If you would like to find code for a specific exercise, please find the corresponding commit and look at code diff.

For example, lab 4's code can be found at [lab4](https://github.com/valkjsaaa/PKU-OS-Labs/tree/lab4). Exercise 10's code change can be found at [Exercise 10](https://github.com/valkjsaaa/PKU-OS-Labs/commit/b05c386ff814dfdc3a5f4040bbfd5f12ce59d8e8).

### Notice

Some commits(exercises) might have bug that are fixed in latter commit(exercise). One way to deal with this problem is to look at the relevent lines in master repository. This repository can pass all the grade script in all labs, and thus less bug. You can alos look at line blame in this repo to find out if there is a bug fix later commit.

### Pull requests are welcome

If you finished another challenge or find a bug in my code and willing to share with others, feel free to send a pull request :)
